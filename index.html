                        At Torch, we believe that client happiness and code sanity is what define us better, so we always stay close with the latest technologies and ship stability with it.

                        We do the same thing software factories do, but with the heart of a startup. As a small development team we move fast and synchronized, but most important, we care about what we do, just because we love it.<br/><br/>
                        We create admin tools, marketing solutions, everything from small mobile apps
                        to big web sites and we customize every detail with quality; we create secure server side apps with smooth high-tech client experience.<br/><br/>
                        You dream it, we build it.

                        We take security as a priority, so we run all of our code through Github. We work with Rails, .Net and if you’re up to it, we also work with Salesforce. Our projects are full of responsiveness thanks to AngularJS, ReactJS and our own custom JS experiences.<br/><br/>
                        We use Agile methodologies for the best organization while managing projects (scrum framework). For this purpose we use Trello, Assembla, Jira or any board that suits you.<br/><br/>
                        If you need to go mobile, we do Hybrid tech: Ionic allows us to deliver iOS and Android apps with our custom servers on Rails, or connecting to your backend API if needed.<br/><br/>
                        These are just a few of the Techs we roll:

                            He doesn't know the meaning of surrender, and he is a passionate code reviewer.
